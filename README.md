# Unsupervided_Learning_Mac_or_Windows
Analyzed and interpreted an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data. This will require an ability to code unsupervised machine learning algorithms and interpret their results. When comparing Mac and Windows users while approaching the big five personality traits, factors were taken into account during proper separation of data based on its purpose and characteristics (demographics, psychometrics, etc.) and when utilizing appropriate unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering and PCA. The analysis provided key insights to specific patterns among the respondents and identified important target groups.
